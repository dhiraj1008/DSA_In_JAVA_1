## Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

#### This project delves into the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms, providing you with the tools to build efficient and well-organized Java applications.

### What We Will Cover

* Basic Data Structures: Build a solid foundation with core structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
* Big O Notation: Master the art of analyzing algorithm efficiency by understanding Big O notation.
* Searching Algorithms: Explore efficient techniques for finding elements within data structures (linear search, binary search, etc.).
* Sorting Algorithms: Learn how to order data effectively using algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and more.
* Graphs: Discover the power of graphs in representing relationships between entities and delve into graph algorithms.
* Trees: Master the hierarchical data structure of trees and explore various tree implementations like binary search trees.
* Performance Analysis: Understand how to measure and compare the execution time of algorithms for informed decision-making.
